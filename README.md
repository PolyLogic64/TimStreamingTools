# TimStreamingTools
A tool that I use form Streaming.
It has a Music Section where you can display a the current Spotify Song in a text file,
but it has the ability to add Padding Spaces or Padding Characters at the end of the file.

The Time section of the program is not finished but it will still display the current time with the timezone but it will be relative to gmt
